<h1>50 word description of myself</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Shannon Kaur Khosa. I'm 15 and my birthdate is February 16, 2007. I like going out with friends, watching horror movies with my family, taking long walks in the evening, and listening to music. I also love cooking/baking for my family on the weekends. I usually listen to music while I'm cooking/baking, studying, doing homework, and taking walks.</p>

<h1>50 word description of career plans</h1>
<p>I don't really know what my career plans are yet, but I'm thinking of becoming a lawyer. My sister (20yrs) thought of it I agreed soon after. I think it would be a suitable job for me and I'd like it because I like social studies the most out of the four main subjects ( social studies, english, math, science). Again, I'm not sure about what career I want to fulfill yet.</p>
